This algorithm works on the fact that if an element occurs more than N/2 times, it means that the remaining elements other than this would definitely be less than N/2. 

If want to get all elements that occure more than N/3 times, then there should be at at most two candidates that over N/3 and the reaming 
elements are definitely less then N/3
